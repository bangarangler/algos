## Fibonacci Sequence

_Every other element is the sum of its two preceding elements_

#### Example

> [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...]

Return the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence.
ts: fib(4) yields 5

### Plan

1. Calculate the sequence up to the element we're looking for
2. return that element
